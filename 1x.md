explain: Pickleball From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Here is an explanation of pickleball based on the information provided:

Pickleball is a racket sport that originated in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, USA. It is played between two players (singles) or four players (doubles) using solid paddles to hit a perforated, hollow plastic ball over a 34-inch high net.

Some key characteristics of pickleball:

- Court dimensions: 44 feet long, 20 feet wide
- Paddle size is larger than a table tennis paddle
- Ball has less bounce than a tennis ball
- There is a "non-volley zone" (kitchen) 7 feet from the net where players cannot strike the ball before it bounces
- Serves must be made underhand 
- Only the server can score points (side-out scoring)

Pickleball resembles both tennis and table tennis but has its own distinct rules and equipment. It became popular in the Pacific Northwest US starting in the 1960s, and has since grown rapidly in popularity across the United States and internationally. As of 2023, it is estimated to have over 4.8 million players in the US, making it one of the fastest growing sports. This growth is attributed to its short learning curve, appeal to various ages/fitness levels, and low startup costs.

Pickleball is governed internationally by the International Federation of Pickleball, and has several major tournaments including the US National Championships and US Open. While not an Olympic sport, it is played worldwide through national and international competitions.

Pickleball is a unique racket sport that originated in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, USA. It is played between two players (singles) or four players (doubles) using solid paddles to hit a perforated, hollow plastic ball over a 34-inch high net.

Some key details about the sport:

- Court Dimensions: The pickleball court is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide, smaller than a tennis court.
- Paddles: The paddles used in pickleball are larger than table tennis paddles, allowing for more control and power.
- Ball: The hard plastic pickleball has less bounce than a tennis ball, resulting in a faster-paced game.
- Non-Volley Zone: There is a 7-foot area on each side of the net called the "non-volley zone" or "kitchen" where players cannot volley the ball before it bounces.
- Serving: All serves must be made underhand to start the rally.
- Scoring: Pickleball uses a side-out scoring system where only the serving player/team can score points.

The unique combination of court size, equipment, and rules gives pickleball a distinct feel compared to other racket sports like tennis and ping-pong. This has contributed to its rapid growth in popularity, especially in the United States.

Since its invention in 1965, pickleball has steadily gained traction, first in the Pacific Northwest and then across the country. By 2023, it was estimated to have over 4.8 million players nationwide, making it one of the fastest growing sports according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association. This surge in popularity is attributed to pickleball's short learning curve, appeal to players of all ages and skill levels, and relatively low startup costs.

Pickleball is governed internationally by the International Federation of Pickleball. While not an Olympic sport, it is played competitively through national and international tournaments, including the US National Championships and US Open. The sport's continued growth across the US and globally indicates it has firmly established itself as a popular recreational and competitive racket sport.

Pickleball is a racket or paddle sport in which two players (singles) or four players (doubles) hit a perforated, hollow plastic ball with paddles over a 34-inch-high (0.86 m) net until one side is unable to return the ball or commits a rule infraction. Pickleball is played indoors and outdoors. It was invented in 1965 as a children's backyard game in the United States, on Bainbridge Island in Washington state. In 2022, pickleball was named the official state sport of Washington.[2]

While it resembles tennis and table tennis, pickleball has separate rules, paddles, and court dimensions. The court is 44 feet (13.4m) long and 20 feet (6.1m) wide, and the paddle is larger than the one used in table tennis. The hard plastic ball used in pickleball produces less bounce than tennis balls. On each side of the net is a 7-foot area (2.1 m) known as the non-volley zone (or the kitchen); a player standing therein may not strike the ball until it has bounced. The rules specify side-out scoring, where only the server can score a point. The minimal amount of bounce, the non-volley zones, and the underhanded stroke with which all serves are made, give the game a dynamic pace.

Between 1965 and 2020, pickleball became a popular sport in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, and began to grow in popularity elsewhere. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, the sport was named the fastest-growing sport in the United States by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, and by 2023 it was estimated to have over 4.8 million players. The growing popularity of the sport has been attributed to its short learning curve, its appeal to a wide range of ages and fitness levels, and its low startup costs. There are now thousands of pickleball tournaments throughout the United States, including the U.S. National Championships and the U.S. Open Tournament, along with two professional tours and one professional league. Pickleball is also growing in popularity outside the United States: there are several other national and international competitions.
